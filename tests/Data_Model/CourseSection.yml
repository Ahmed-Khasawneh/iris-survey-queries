    comments: "CourseSection.courseSectionLevel could match Course.courseLevel, but allows for varying values as needed.\n 
      For example, an Independent Study course could have differing levels for course sections, based on student level.\n
      If level is assigned based solely on subject and course number, use the same value in both Course.courseLevel and 
      CourseSection.courseSectionLevel.\n
      If level is assigned based partly on course section, the Course.courseLevel value can be null.\n
      Either CourseSection.courseSectionLevel or Course.courseLevel should have an applicable level value."
