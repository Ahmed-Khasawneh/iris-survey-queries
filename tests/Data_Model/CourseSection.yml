      Value is client-defined, but is typically the Course Reference Number (CRN), the Course Section Identifier or a combination of data fields that result in a unique value.
      The value for courseSectionNumber will be referenced as a one-to-one relationship in Registration, CourseSectionSchedule and InstructionalAssignment.

      CourseSection.courseSectionLevel could match Course.courseLevel, but allows for varying values as needed. For example, an Independent Study course could have differing levels for course sections, based on student level.
      If level is assigned based solely on subject and course number, use the same value in both Course.courseLevel and CourseSection.courseSectionLevel.
      If level is assigned based partly on course section, the Course.courseLevel value can be null.
      Either CourseSection.courseSectionLevel or Course.courseLevel should have an applicable level value.
