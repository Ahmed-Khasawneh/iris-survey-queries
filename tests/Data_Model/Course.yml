    comments:
      "Course.courseLevel could match CourseSection.courseSectionLevel, but allows for varying values as needed.\n
      For example, an Independent Study course could have differing levels for course sections where level is based on student.\n
      If level is assigned based solely on subject and course number, use the same value in both Course.courseLevel and
      CourseSection.courseSectionLevel.\n
      If level is assigned based partly on course section, the Course.courseLevel value can be null.\n
      Either CourseSection.courseSectionLevel or Course.courseLevel should have an applicable level value."
